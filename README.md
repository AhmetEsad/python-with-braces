~2.5 hour "fixing python by adding curly brackets for code blocks" project

disclaimer
- there are probably a lot of things i missed (classes come to mind first, i don't think i covered classes) as i do not write python often
- probably very easy to break. do not count on it
- bad/hacky code. do not use this

how to use
- bun index.ts (...args)
example: bun index.ts --outFolder "./demo/out"
see pybconfig.json for default values (you can edit those but the ones provided from the CLI will be prioritized)

oh and no github copilot / AI was used except for that one time i asked chatgpt where curly brackets are used in python
